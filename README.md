# Python CLI for downloading all the videos and images from a 4chan thread

  

Of course you need python to run this script

  

This script will make a directory called 4chan in the current directory it is invoked from

then it will ask you for the link to the thread and then for the name of the sub directory of the 4chan directory

where all the videos and pics of that thread will be stored

  

Its really easy to use:

  

1) Run the sciprt

  

2) Enter the url of the thread

  

3) Enter the the name you would like to use for the directory that will contain all the downloaded data

  

4) Wait for the download to finish and thats it

  

I hope you enjoy this sciprt
